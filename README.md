## ⚒ Overview

`pikesquares` is a developer-friendly, unobtrusive tool for deploying and managing services, such as web applications, APIs, periodic jobs, and background workers.

Named after a [military tactical formation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pike_square), where 10 rows of soldiers organized in 10 columns wielded pikes ♠️, the tool takes inspiration from the same disciplined structure.

As a single executable with no external dependencies, `pikesquares` runs as a long-lived service, whether locally or on virtually any cloud hosting provider.

This approach embodies simplicity and precision—offering a unified, modular framework that accelerates local development, testing, and deployment, making it a robust foundation for modern applications.

## Philosophy
 ⚔︎⛊ In the chaos of battle, discipline wins wars. We've fought through the confusion of virtual environments, tangled runtimes, and the endless struggle of reviving old projects. From that battlefield, `pikesquares` was forged.

⚔︎⛊  No more disorder. No more wasted time. `pikesquares` stands as your formation—building, deploying, running, and scaling your application with zero configuration.

⚔︎⛊ We believe in open source—software should be free and accessible, not locked behind monopolistic SaaS models.

⚔︎⛊ Strength lies in simplicity. `pikesquares` is a single, lightweight binary—small, compact, and battle-ready. No bloat, no excess, just raw efficiency.

⚔︎⛊ We are disciplined and precise.`pikesquares` won't overrun your system, clutter your directories, or disrupt your workflow. It strikes with accuracy, leaving no unnecessary trace.

⚔︎⛊ We fight in the terminal. The command line is our battlefield, where every move is deliberate, every action clear. Power comes from understanding what’s happening under the hood.
